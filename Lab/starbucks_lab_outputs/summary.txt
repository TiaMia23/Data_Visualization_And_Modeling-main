1  Courtney         Apopka, FL   Reviewed July 16, 2023     5.0  ** at the Starbucks by the fire station on 436 in Altamonte Springs, FL made my day and finally helped me figure out the way to make my drink so I’d love it. She took time out to talk to me for 2 minutes to make my experience better than what I’m used to. It was much appreciated! I’ve had bad experiences one after another at the Starbucks that’s closest to me in my work building with my drinks not being great along with not great customer service from specific baristas. Niko was refreshing to speak to and pleasant. The drink was perfect!

This made my day, but made me look like a fool because my card didn’t work. All thanks to Dillon. At Shoreline WA in Safeway. Thank you so much Dillon for the help, support and, kindness.

I work for Instacart right now and every location of Starbucks I was given free hot water because I asked for it without being charged. I really appreciate Starbucks for giving me the opportunity to do such thing. That’s why I give them five stars. They fully have my support. They’re super nice and professional and the coffee is great. Go to Starbucks.
